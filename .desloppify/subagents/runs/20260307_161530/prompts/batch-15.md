You are a focused subagent reviewer for a single holistic investigation batch.

Repository root: /Users/charlesdunda/src/s33dunda/RogueNode-desloppify
Blind packet: /Users/charlesdunda/src/s33dunda/RogueNode-desloppify/.desloppify/review_packet_blind.json
Batch index: 15
Batch name: initialization_coupling
Batch rationale: seed files for initialization_coupling review

DIMENSION TO EVALUATE:

## initialization_coupling
Boot-order dependencies, import-time side effects, global singletons
Look for:
- Module-level code that depends on another module having been imported first
- Import-time side effects: DB connections, file I/O, network calls at module scope
- Global singletons where creation order matters across modules
- Environment variable reads at import time (fragile in testing)
- Circular init dependencies hidden behind conditional or lazy imports
- Module-level constants computed at import time alongside a dynamic getter function — consumers referencing the stale snapshot instead of calling the getter
Skip:
- Standard library initialization (logging.basicConfig)
- Framework bootstrap (app.configure, server.listen)

YOUR TASK: Read the code for this batch's dimension. Judge how well the codebase serves a developer from that perspective. The dimension rubric above defines what good looks like. Cite specific observations that explain your judgment.

Mechanical scan evidence — navigation aid, not scoring evidence:
The blind packet contains `holistic_context.scan_evidence` with aggregated signals from all mechanical detectors — including complexity hotspots, error hotspots, signal density index, boundary violations, and systemic patterns. Use these as starting points for where to look beyond the seed files.

Seed files (start here):
- convex/gameActions.ts
- components/GameTerminal.tsx
- convex/schema.ts
- convex/missions.ts
- convex/agents/pingAgent.ts
- convex/cacheCleanup.ts
- convex/utils/cacheUtils.ts
- components/TerminalOutput.tsx
- components/TerminalInput.tsx
- components/CRTEffects.tsx
- app/layout.tsx
- app/page.tsx
- components/ConvexClientProvider.tsx
- convex/lib/auth.ts
- lib/hooks/useCommandProcessor.ts
- convex/types.ts

Task requirements:
1. Read the blind packet's `system_prompt` — it contains scoring rules and calibration.
2. Start from the seed files, then freely explore the repository to build your understanding.
3. Keep issues and scoring scoped to this batch's dimension.
4. Respect scope controls: do not include files/directories marked by `exclude`, `suppress`, or non-production zone overrides.
5. Return 0-10 issues for this batch (empty array allowed).
6. For initialization_coupling, use evidence from `holistic_context.scan_evidence.mutable_globals` and `holistic_context.errors.mutable_globals`. Investigate initialization ordering dependencies, coupling through shared mutable state, and whether state should be encapsulated behind a proper registry/context manager.
7. Workflow integrity checks: when reviewing orchestration/queue/review flows,
8. xplicitly look for loop-prone patterns and blind spots:
9. - repeated stale/reopen churn without clear exit criteria or gating,
10. - packet/batch data being generated but dropped before prompt execution,
11. - ranking/triage logic that can starve target-improving work,
12. - reruns happening before existing open review work is drained.
13. If found, propose concrete guardrails and where to implement them.
14. Do not edit repository files.
15. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences.
