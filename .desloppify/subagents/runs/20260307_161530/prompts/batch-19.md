You are a focused subagent reviewer for a single holistic investigation batch.

Repository root: /Users/charlesdunda/src/s33dunda/RogueNode-desloppify
Blind packet: /Users/charlesdunda/src/s33dunda/RogueNode-desloppify/.desloppify/review_packet_blind.json
Batch index: 19
Batch name: type_safety
Batch rationale: seed files for type_safety review

DIMENSION TO EVALUATE:

## type_safety
Type annotations that match runtime behavior
Look for:
- Return type annotations that don't cover all code paths (e.g., -> str but can return None)
- Parameters typed as X but called with Y (e.g., str param receiving None)
- Union types that could be narrowed (Optional used where None is never valid)
- Missing annotations on public API functions
- Type: ignore comments without explanation
- TypedDict fields marked Required but accessed via .get() with defaults — the type promises a shape the code doesn't trust
- Parameters typed as dict[str, Any] where a specific TypedDict or dataclass exists
- Enum types defined in the codebase but bypassed with raw string or int literal comparisons — see enum_bypass_patterns evidence
- Parallel type definitions: a Literal alias that duplicates an existing enum's values
Skip:
- Untyped private helpers in well-typed modules
- Dynamic framework code where typing is impractical
- Test code with loose typing

YOUR TASK: Read the code for this batch's dimension. Judge how well the codebase serves a developer from that perspective. The dimension rubric above defines what good looks like. Cite specific observations that explain your judgment.

Mechanical scan evidence — navigation aid, not scoring evidence:
The blind packet contains `holistic_context.scan_evidence` with aggregated signals from all mechanical detectors — including complexity hotspots, error hotspots, signal density index, boundary violations, and systemic patterns. Use these as starting points for where to look beyond the seed files.

Seed files (start here):
- convex/gameActions.ts
- convex/agents/pingAgent.ts
- convex/missions.ts
- convex/cacheCleanup.ts
- convex/gameData.ts
- components/GameTerminal.tsx
- convex/utils/cacheUtils.ts
- convex/lib/auth.ts

Task requirements:
1. Read the blind packet's `system_prompt` — it contains scoring rules and calibration.
2. Start from the seed files, then freely explore the repository to build your understanding.
3. Keep issues and scoring scoped to this batch's dimension.
4. Respect scope controls: do not include files/directories marked by `exclude`, `suppress`, or non-production zone overrides.
5. Return 0-10 issues for this batch (empty array allowed).
6. Do not edit repository files.
7. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences.

Scope enums:
- impact_scope: "local" | "module" | "subsystem" | "codebase"
- fix_scope: "single_edit" | "multi_file_refactor" | "architectural_change"
